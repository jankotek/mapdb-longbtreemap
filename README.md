This library offers BTreeMap which uses primitive `long` as key. 
It brings less memory overhead, better memory locality and better performance. 

TO use it with maven:
```xml
TODO snapshot repo:

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.mapdb</groupId>
            <artifactId>mapdb-longbtreemap</artifactId>
            <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
```

And instantiate using following code.

```java


```
